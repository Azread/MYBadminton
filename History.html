        <h5><p>
            The predecessor of badminton was cricket (but now badminton and cricket
            has evolved into two different ball sports), ie
            use a wooden board to hit a furry ball (similar to a feather
            dodge), and let it dodge the game. With almost history
            2000 years, it can be seen in ancient Europe, China and Japan.
            Among them, a type of badminton board comes from ancient Greece, and it
            developed to convert solid wood rackets into wooden frames, and
            tie a tight sheepskin in the middle, which is easier to
            beaten for its elasticity. The game spread east to India
            ancient and as far as Siam, China and Japan. However, the purpose
            the game is to keep the ball in the air as much as possible
            without landing, which is very different from the spirit of modern badminton.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the middle of the 19th century, modern badminton appeared in Pune, west
            India, which was called by the place name "Poona" at that time. Because
            The local British loved this new sport, they brought it back to
            British mainland. In 1873, a public performance was
            held at Badminton Manor in Gloucestershire, England, which is interesting
            the attention of many people and gradually spread. Then,
            the people call the sport by the name of the manor of the show,
            "Badminton". However, in Chinese-speaking areas, this name is not
            popularized, and it is called "Badminton" according to the equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Early British badminton still used the unwritten rules of
            India, but it is often controversial for not being strict enough.
            In 1887, "Bath Badminton Club" researched and improved, and
            solve the first written badminton rules. In 1893,
            The English Badminton Association was set up to review
            and unifying the rules of the game of badminton. In 1898, Open
            Guilford, considered the first official open competition
            badminton, has been successfully held in Guildford, Surrey, England, and
            leading to the longest running open badminton, the Open
            All England, held on April 4.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1934, the first worldwide badminton organization,
            The International Badminton Federation (IBF), was established in the United
            Kingdom. In 1981, it merged with the Badminton Federation
            World (WBF), which was established in 1978, and its name is still
            International Badminton Federation. On September 24, 2006,
            The International Badminton Federation has changed its name to
            Badminton World Federation (BWF). Now there are 159 countries or
            member territory.
